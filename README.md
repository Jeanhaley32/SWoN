Python project, Mainframe database for a Role Playing game.

This was my first tiny coding project. I aimed to create a Ships computer terminal interface for a Space Themed Role Playing
game that a friend of mine was running at the time. It basically was me trying to figure out how to create a menu and options
system based on inspiration after reading a chapter on dictionaries from the book  "Python Crash Course"
